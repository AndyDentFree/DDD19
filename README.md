# DDD19
Key links and material for my animation session at [DDD 2019 conference][ddd] in Perth, Western Australia.

## Authoring Tools used
I am using a Markdown approach and based on a [Hacker news thread][hn] decided to try using [markdeck][md] which augments `reveal.hs` with a bunch of other goodies.

I started considering the highly-recommended [DeckSet app for Mac][deckset] but it lacks HTML-based presentation.
